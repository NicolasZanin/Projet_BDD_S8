<th>Slow cooker meatballs</th>
<th>Easy<br>Try these slow cooker meatballs for a tasty family meal. Turkey mince makes lighter meatballs which kids love. They also freeze well so you can batch cook<button class="showModal">+</button><button class="hideModal">-</button><p class="modal">
                Heat the slow cooker if necessary. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic and fry gently for a minute. Pour in the passata, add the parsley and stir, then transfer the lot to the slow cooker.
                To make the meatballs, tip the mince into a large bowl. Add the oats, paprika, garlic and plenty of black pepper, and mix everything together with your hands. Divide the mixture into 20 lumps about the size of a walnut and roll each piece into a meatball. Spray or run a non-stick pan with a little oil and gently cook the meatballs until they start to brown. Add them to the tomato base and cook on Low for 5 hours. Serve over rice or pasta if you like, or with a green salad.

<th>Slow cooker mac ’n’ cheese</th>
<th>Easy<br>There’s no need to make a white sauce with this easy recipe. Just tip the ingredients into your slow cooker for a velvety smooth veggie pasta dish<button class="showModal">+</button><button class="hideModal">-</button><p class="modal">
                Pour boiling water over the pasta and drain, then put everything in a slow cooker and stir well. Season, cover and cook on low for 1 hr. Stir again, put the lid back on and cook for another 30 mins until the pasta is cooked and the sauce has reduced enough to coat the macaroni.
                Leave the lid off and reduce for the last 10 mins if you need to, or add a splash more milk – this will depend on the size of your slow cooker and the brand. Serve with extra cheese.

<th>Slow cooker vegetable lasagne</th>
<th>Easy<br>Make this low-calorie veggie lasagne as a lighter alternative to the traditional bake. It's layered with pasta, ratatouille and sliced aubergine, and packs in all of your five-a-day<button class="showModal">+</button><button class="hideModal">-</button><p class="modal">
                Heat 1 tbsp rapeseed oil in a large non-stick pan and fry 2 sliced onions and 2 chopped large garlic cloves for 5 mins, stirring frequently until softened
                Tip in 2 diced large courgettes, 1 red and 1 yellow pepper, both roughly sliced, and 400g chopped tomatoes with 2 tbsp tomato purée, 2 tsp vegetable bouillon and 15g chopped basil.
                Stir well, cover and cook for 5 mins. Don't be tempted to add more liquid as plenty of moisture will come from the vegetables once they start cooking.
                Slice 1 large aubergine. Lay half the slices of aubergine in the base of the slow cooker and top with 3 sheets of lasagne.
                Add a third of the ratatouille mixture, then the remaining aubergine slices, 3 more lasagne sheets, then the remaining ratatouille mixture.
                Cover and cook on High for 2½ - 3 hours until the pasta and vegetables are tender. Turn off the machine.
                Scatter 125g vegetarian buffalo mozzarella over the vegetables then cover and leave for 10 mins to settle and melt the cheese.
                Scatter with extra basil and serve with a handful of rocket.
